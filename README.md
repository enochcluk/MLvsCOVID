Steps:
1. Data cleaning and organization
2. Visualization
3. Stationary model(one week delay) and check for under/over fitting
use binary search to find best time delay?
Issues = drop in weekend testing, contraction-reporting delay
4. Auto-regressive integrated moving average (arima modeling)
5. Account for seasonality and exogenous factors
